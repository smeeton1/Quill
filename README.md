# Quill

Quill is for simulating quantum walkers in open systems.

### Features

The code is capable of simulating single walkers as well as systems made up of multiple walkers on a shared graph. The walkers can be interacting or no interacting.

There is code to calculate both classical and a version of quantum pagerank. 

An example of how to use the code to simulate electron transport is included.

Finally various measures for quantum correlations are included in the package.
